A certain amount of knowledge you can indeed with average faculties acquire so as to retain; nor need you regret the hours you spent on much that is forgotten, for the shadow of lost knowledge at least protects you from many illusions. But you go to a great school not so much for knowledge as for arts and habits; for the habit of attention, for the art of expression, for the art of assuming at a moment's notice a new intellectual position, for the art of entering quickly into another person's thoughts, for the habit of submitting to censure and refutation, for the art of indicating assent or dissent in graduated terms, for the habit of regarding minute points of accuracy, for the art of working out what is possible in a given time, for taste, for discrimination, for mental courage, and for mental soberness.</div></blockquote> </div> <div class="zm-editable-content clearfix"> <hr /> </div> <div class="zm-editable-content clearfix" style="text-align: center;">2015年12月14日 @ 09:14</div> <div class="zm-editable-content clearfix"></div> <div class="zm-editable-content clearfix"> <blockquote> <div>"古希腊几何学家阿波洛尼乌斯总结了圆锥曲线理论，一千八百年后由德国天文学家开普勒将其应用于行星轨道理论。数学家伽罗华公元1831年创立群论，一百余年后获得物理应用。公元1860年创立的矩阵理论在六十年后应用量子力学。数学家莱姆伯脱，高斯，黎曼，罗马切夫斯基等人提出并发展了非欧几何，高斯一生都在探索非欧几何的实际应用，但他抱憾而终。非欧几何诞生一百七十年后，这种在当时毫无用处的理论以及由之发展而来的张量分析理论成为爱因斯坦广义相对论的核心基础。何夕提出并于公元1999年完成的微连续理论，一百五十年后这一成果最终导致了大统一场理论方程式的诞生。"</div><p align="right">——何夕《伤心者》</p></blockquote> </div>

<blockquote> <div> <div> Fall in love with some activity, and do it! Nobody ever figures out what life is all about, and it doesn’t matter. Explore the world. Nearly everything is really interesting if you go into it deeply enough. Work as hard and as much as you want to on the things you like to do the best. Don’t think about what you want to be, but what you want to do. Keep up some kind of a minimum with other things so that society doesn’t stop you from doing anything at all. --Richard Feynman </div> </div></blockquote> 

<div> <div> <blockquote>From this distant vantage point, the Earth might not seem of any particular interest. But for us, it's different. Consider again that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every "superstar," every "supreme leader," every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there – on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam. The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that in glory and triumph they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot. Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner. How frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how fervent their hatreds. Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have some privileged position in the universe, are challenged by this point of pale light. Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity – in all this vastness – there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves. The Earth is the only world known, so far, to harbor life. There is nowhere else, at least in the near future, to which our species could migrate. Visit, yes. Settle, not yet. Like it or not, for the moment, the Earth is where we make our stand. It has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character-building experience. There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we've ever known.</blockquote> <div class="templatequotecite" align="right"><cite>    — <a title="Carl Sagan" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Sagan">Carl Sagan</a>, <i><a class="mw-redirect" title="Pale Blue Dot: A Vision of the Human Future in Space" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pale_Blue_Dot:_A_Vision_of_the_Human_Future_in_Space">Pale Blue Dot: A Vision of the Human Future in Space</a></i>, 1997 reprint, pp. xv–xvi</cite></div> </div> </div> <div class="templatequotecite"></div> <div class="templatequotecite"> <ul> <li>Niels Henrik Abel，死于肺结核，死后被认为是现代数学先驱，年27.</li> <li>Évariste Galois，死于决斗，年21，太憋屈了，群论的创立者.</li> <li>ஸ்ரீனிவாஸ ராமானுஜன் ஐயங்கார்，印度天才数学家，善于直接手写各种神奇公式，死于肺结核，年33.</li> <li>Georg Friedrich Bernhard Riemann，死于肺结核，年40.</li> </ul> </div> <div> <blockquote>人会死三次。 第一次是他停止呼吸的时候，在生物学上他死了。 第二次是他下葬的时候，人们来参加他的葬礼，怀念他的一生，在社会上他死了。 第三次是最后一个记得他的人把他忘记的时候，那时他才真正的死了。</blockquote> 
在第一次和第三次之间，我虽然还没有真的死去，却无法感受自己的存在。 曾经害怕考试，然而真正害怕和遗憾的，或许是，用一生完成的答卷，却没法得知最后的成绩。 </div>
